## How the Internet Works?  

## 1. History of the Web (Web 1.0 → Web 3.0)  
```
Web 1.0 was read-only. Users could only open pages and read information. There was no login, no comments, no interaction.
Web 2.0 made the web interactive. Users could create content, like posts, videos, and comments. Examples are social media and web apps.
Web 3.0 focuses on decentralization. Instead of one company owning data, blockchain allows users to control data and digital assets.

Interview tip: Web 2.0 = interaction, Web 3.0 = decentralization + blockchain.

## 2. How Computers Communicate with Each Other
```
Computers communicate using protocols, which are agreed rules.
The most important one on the internet is TCP/IP.

Data is not sent as one big piece. It is broken into small packets.
Each packet contains the source address, destination address, and data.

Interview tip: “Computers communicate using TCP/IP and packet switching.”
```

## 3. How Data Travels All Over the World
```
When you request a website, your data does not travel in a straight line.
It passes through routers, switches, and servers.

Routers decide the best path for each packet.
If one path is busy or broken, routers choose another path automatically.

Interview tip: This is called packet switching, not direct connection.
```
## 4. Domain Name, IP Address, MAC Address & Routing
```
A domain name is for humans (example: google.com).
An IP address is for machines (example: 142.250.182.14).

A MAC address is a hardware address used inside local networks.
It never changes and is fixed to the network device.

Routing means deciding how data moves from source IP to destination IP through routers.

Interview tip: Domain → DNS → IP → Routing → Server.
```

## 5. How ISP and DNS Work Together
```
Your ISP gives you internet access. Without ISP, you cannot connect to the internet.

When you type a domain name, DNS converts it into an IP address.
Your ISP contacts the DNS server, gets the IP, and then fetches data from the server.

Finally, the data is sent back to your device as packets.

Interview tip: DNS resolves names, ISP delivers data.
