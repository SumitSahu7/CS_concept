## Preparing Your Machine

## 1. Installing & Setting Up VS Code

```
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight and powerful code editor.

After installing, open VS Code and explore:

Explorer (for files and folders)

Editor (where you write code)

Terminal (for running commands)

- Interview tip: VS Code is an editor, not an IDE, but becomes powerful with extensions.
```

## 2. Installing Helpful Extensions

```
Extensions improve productivity and code quality.

Important ones:

Live Server – Runs a local development server

Prettier – Formats code automatically

ESLint – Finds JavaScript errors

HTML CSS Support – Better suggestions

- Interview tip: Extensions help with formatting, debugging, and live preview.
```

## 3. Setting Up Your Browser for Development

```
Browsers are development tools, not just viewers.

Use Chrome or Edge DevTools:

Inspect HTML and CSS

Debug JavaScript

Monitor network requests

Open DevTools using F12 or Ctrl + Shift + I.

- Interview tip: DevTools help debug front-end issues.
```

## Files and Folders (Basic Computer Science)

```
A file stores data like code, text, or images.
A folder (directory) organizes related files.

To create:

Right-click → New File / Folder

Or use terminal commands

Good structure improves readability and maintenance.

- Interview tip: Folder structure reflects project organization.
```

## Testing Environment: “Namaste Duniya”

```
Create an index.html file.

Write basic HTML and save it.
Open with Live Server or directly in the browser.

If the browser shows “Namaste Duniya”, your environment is ready.

- Interview tip: Serving a page proves your setup works.
```
