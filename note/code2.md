## Client–Server Architecture

## What is the Client–Server Model

```
The client–server model is a way of dividing work between two systems.

The client requests data or services.
The server processes the request and sends back a response.

This separation makes systems scalable, secure, and easier to manage.

- Interview tip: Client requests, server responds.
```

## Client (Browser) vs Server (Hosting Computer)

```
A client is usually a browser like Chrome or Edge.
Its job is to send requests and display data to the user.

A server is a powerful computer that stores websites, APIs, and databases.
Its job is to process logic, fetch data, and send responses.

- Interview tip: Browser = presentation, Server = logic + data.
```

## HTTP Request and Response Cycle

```
When a browser needs data, it sends an HTTP request to the server.
This request contains method (GET, POST), headers, and sometimes data.

The server processes the request and sends an HTTP response.
The response includes status code, headers, and the requested content.

- Interview tip: Request → Process → Response.
```

## What Happens When You Visit a Website

```
You type a URL in the browser.
DNS converts the domain name into an IP address.

The browser sends an HTTP request to the server.
The server responds with HTML, CSS, JS, and other files.

The browser renders the page and shows it to you.
- Interview tip: DNS → HTTP → Render.
```

## Front-end vs Back-end

```
Front-end is what users see and interact with.
It runs in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Back-end runs on the server.
It handles business logic, authentication, and database operations.

- Interview tip: Front-end = UI, Back-end = logic + data.
```

## Static Websites vs Dynamic Websites

```
A static website shows the same content to every user.
Pages are already built and do not change automatically.

A dynamic website generates content at runtime.
Content changes based on user input, database data, or authentication.

- Interview tip: Static = fixed content, Dynamic = data-driven.
```

## What is Web Hosting and How It Works

```
Web hosting means storing your website files on a server connected to the internet.

A hosting provider gives you server space, bandwidth, and an IP address.
When users visit your site, the server sends files to their browser.

- Interview tip: Hosting = making your site accessible online.
